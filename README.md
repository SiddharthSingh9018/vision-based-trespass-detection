\# Vision-Based Trespass Detection



\## Overview

This project implements a real-time vision-based trespass detection system.

It combines motion-based filtering with human detection to identify potential

unauthorized presence in video streams.



\## Pipeline

Video Stream → Motion Detection → Human Detection → Alerting



\## Design Principles

\- Latency-aware processing

\- Modular separation of concerns

\- Reduced computation via motion gating



\## Non-Goals

\- General intrusion detection

\- Identity recognition

\- Adversarial robustness



\## Status

Repository initialized. Refactoring and modularization in progress.
